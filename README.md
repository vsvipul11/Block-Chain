# Block-Chain
<hr>
<h4>A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of its data. This is because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks. </h4>

<h4>In this project I Implented a simple blockchain from scratch using just node Js and Typescript . This Blockchain contains wallets where users can send money back and forth. Each transaction is added into block then that block is mined with a proof of work system using MD-5 algorithm.< /h4>
